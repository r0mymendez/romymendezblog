![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zglcinhbzlze6u59qrl6.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# üü† GitHub Foundations Learning Path

In order to effectively study and understand all the essential content for the certification, I completed the [**'GitHub Foundations Learning Path'**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/o1njfe825p602p) provided by **Microsoft Learn**.
This path consists of 15 modules, totaling approximately ‚åõ 10 hours, with each module averaging about ‚åõ 35 minutes.
The journey combines üìö theoretical knowledge with ‚úèÔ∏èhands-on exercises, enabling me to effectively learn and apply the concepts.

## Practices with GitHub Actions

The modules include ‚úèÔ∏è hands-on exercises solved in stages, using **GitHub Actions** to validate each step of the process.
This inspired me to develop similar tutorials for future posts.

## Interactive Console

Some modules, such as the first one, offer an interactive console that facilitates executing typical Git commands, further enhancing the learning experience.

## Knowledge Check

Each unit includes a set of ‚úèÔ∏èquestions to validate what has been learned, similar to those found on the exam.
\> üôå I recommend completing and reviewing these questions to consolidate the knowledge acquired.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# üü† Overview of Units

With the foundational concepts established, I will now delve into a detailed description of each unit.
Below, you will find explanations of the key elements and tools I studied, and how I organized them to effectively prepare for the certification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üü† Code Management

**Code management on GitHub** is essential for productivity and effective collaboration within development teams.
Below are the key tools that facilitate this management:

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d0xhxcgy6t30nmeei2pf.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìÅ Repository

The **repository** is the core component of a project on GitHub, which is where the source code, along with its version history, documentation, and other relevant resources for the project, is stored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üîÑ Pull Requests

**Pull Requests (PRs)** are a fundamental tool for collaboration on GitHub.
They allow developers to propose changes to the source code, which can then be reviewed and discussed by other team members before being merged into the base code.

**Pull Request States** It is important to understand the possible states of a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub, which can be: \* **Draft**: PRs in draft status are still in development and not yet ready for formal review.
This state allows collaborators to work on a proposal before requesting official feedback.
\* **Open**: Open PRs are ready and available for review and discussion by project collaborators.
This is where proposed changes are evaluated before deciding whether to integrate them into the base code.
\* **Closed**: Closed PRs have not been accepted and therefore will not be merged into the project's base code.
This state may indicate that the proposal was rejected or that the author decided not to proceed with it.
\* **Merged**: Merged PRs have been accepted, and the proposed changes have been successfully integrated with the main branch of the project.
This is the final state of a successful PR.

---
### üîß Issues
**Issues** are tracking tickets used to report bugs, suggest improvements, or discuss new features. They are essential for planning and organizing work within a project, allowing teams to prioritize tasks and track progress.
---

### üí¨ Discussions

**Discussions on GitHub** provide a space where collaborators can engage in broader conversations about the project.
These discussions can be organized into several categories:

-   **üì¢ Announcements:** For communicating important updates about the project.
-   **üí¨ General:** For general conversations that don't fit into any other category.
-   **üí° Ideas:** For proposing and debating new ideas or improvements.
-   **üó≥Ô∏è Polls:** For conducting surveys and gathering community opinions.
-   **üôè Q&A:** For questions and answers about the project.
-   **üôå Show and Tell:** For sharing achievements, demos, or use cases of the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìÅ Gists

**Gists** are a simple way to share snippets of code or text.
They can be public, accessible to anyone, or private, visible only to the creator or those with whom the link is shared.
Gists are useful for quickly sharing code examples, notes, or scripts among collaborators or with the broader community.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\#\#¬†üü† Accounts This is one of the topics where you may encounter questions, and within the recommended learning path, you can find three types of accounts:

-   **üë•Personal Account**: This is the basic account for individual users, allowing them to own and manage repositories, packages, and projects.
-   **üè¢ Organization Account**: Allows multiple users to collaborate on shared projects.
-   **üíº Enterprise Account**: Designed for large companies, it enables centralized management of policies and billing for multiple organizations.

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y05ex70p6a2ftcpgt0fi.png)

Additionally, the existing plans are:

-   **GitHub Free:** Provides the essentials for individuals and organizations, with limited storage and GitHub Actions minutes.

-   **GitHub Pro:** Extends the features of GitHub Free with more GitHub Actions minutes, storage, and advanced tools for private repositories, ideal for individual developers.

-   **GitHub Team:** Similar to GitHub Pro but optimized for organizations, adding advanced team collaboration capabilities.

-   **GitHub Enterprise:** Offers premium support, enhanced security, compliance, and advanced authentication options, along with significantly increased resources and storage. There are two versions of this account type:

    -   **Cloud** (hosted by GitHub)
    -   **Server** (self-managed)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üü† Methodologies

I've titled this section "Methodologies" because throughout different chapters of the learning path, I encountered several methodologies that you need to learn.
Therefore, I decided to group them all under the same concept.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that this is my approach to studying for the certification, and you might find that the learning path or other resources refer to these methodologies differently.

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c8v4lwqmgmlietu383k9.png)

-   **üîÄ GitHub Flow:** A workflow that utilizes specific components (branches, commits, and pull requests) to collaborate and experiment with new features or fixes in a software project.

-   **üîÑ InnerSource:** Involves adopting open-source practices and principles, such as transparency and collaboration, within an organization.
    This means projects are shared internally, allowing any team member to access, modify, and contribute to the code, similar to an open-source project but within the organization.

-   **üõ†Ô∏è Contributing to Projects:** I consider this a methodology because GitHub enables active participation in open-source projects through its platform.
    This practice is not only fundamental for collaborative software development but also promotes learning, innovation, and community building among developers.
    Key considerations include:

    -   **üì¢ Identification and Communication:** Before making changes, it's important to communicate your intentions with the project's maintainers, whether you are addressing an existing issue or proposing a new feature.
    -   **üîÑ Creating a Pull Request:** Once changes are made, a pull request is created on GitHub, allowing others to review, discuss, and eventually merge it with the main codebase.
    -   **üîéReview and Adjustments:** The pull request is reviewed by the project maintainers, who may request adjustments. It's essential to be open to feedback and willing to make necessary changes for your contribution to be accepted.
    -   **üë• Iteration and Ongoing Collaboration:** The review and discussion process around a pull request is iterative and collaborative, allowing for improved software quality and ensuring each contribution aligns with the project's standards and goals.

-   **‚ù§Ô∏è Supporting Projects Financially**: In addition to contributing code and feedback, you can also support open-source projects financially.
    For this reason, GitHub Sponsors allows you to fund projects and individuals to help them continue their open-source work, while giving them the recognition they deserve.
    To support a project:

    -   **Identify Projects**: Explore and select projects you are passionate about.
    -   **Choose a Sponsorship Level**: Pick a tier that fits your budget and desired level of support, with varying benefits such as exclusive content or early access to new features.
    -   **Support and Recognition**: Find the Sponsor button on a project's main page if it's eligible for sponsorship. You can select the sponsorship tier and decide if you want your contribution to be public.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üü† Communication

Communication within a repository is essential and encompasses the detailed documentation of objectives, changes, methodologies, and rules to be applied.
Below are the main tools and practices that facilitate this communication:

-   **üìÑ README File:** The README file is the first line of communication in a project.
    It should contain essential information about the project's purpose, how to use it, how to set it up, and any other relevant details that users and collaborators need to know.

-   **üìö Wiki:** This section is designed to host more extensive and detailed documentation.
    Unlike the README, which is brief and direct, the Wiki is ideal for sharing content such as use cases, examples, design principles, technical details, and any other aspects that require a more in-depth explanation.

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gbwrwdyfccvywl1nhzzt.png)

### üìù Markdown

**Markdown is a markup language** that provides a simple and efficient way to format and style content in issues, README files, wikis, and any other textual documentation within a repository.

If you're not familiar with Markdown, I recommend checking out the [DataCamp CheatSheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/markdown-cheat-sheet-23), which summarizes everything you need to get started.
Additionally, within the chapter, there's an exercise titled ["Exercise - Communicate using Markdown"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/communicate-using-markdown/3-communicating-using-markdown) that will allow you to apply and reinforce your practice using markdown.

-   **‚öôÔ∏è Copilot for CLI**: Assists in creating complex commands and loops in the command line.

### üöÄ GitHub Codespaces

**GitHub Codespaces** provides configurable development environments in the cloud, built on Docker container.
Therefore every each Codespace operates within a üêã Docker container hosted on GitHub.
Also, this container includes all the necessary tools and settings for your project, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment for all project contributors.

Here's an overview of the key functionalities and states of a Codespace:

-   **üõ†Ô∏è Creating Codespaces:** You can create a Codespace from templates, repository branches, open pull requests, or historical commits. By default, each Codespace is based on an Ubuntu Linux image, but you can customize it with any Linux distribution to meet your specific needs. This provides a complete development environment running inside a Docker container on a virtual machine. You can create multiple Codespaces per repository or branch, though there is a limit on the number of simultaneous Codespaces.
-   **üì• Saving Changes:** Changes made within a Codespace are automatically saved when connected through the web. To avoid losing work if the Codespace is deleted, it is crucial to commit and push changes to a remote repository.
-   **üîÑ Reopening and Using Codespaces:** You can reopen active or stopped Codespaces from GitHub.com, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDE, or GitHub CLI. When connected, you access the Docker container of the Codespace, ensuring a consistent development environment accessible from anywhere.
-   **‚è±Ô∏è Timeout and Internet Connection:** Codespaces automatically stop after 30 minutes of inactivity. They require an internet connection, and any uncommitted changes are saved to prevent data loss.
-   **üîß Closing, Stopping, or Rebuilding a Codespace:** You can stop or restart a Codespace to apply configuration changes or troubleshoot issues. You can also rebuild the Codespace to update the Docker container configuration.
-   **üóëÔ∏è Deleting a Codespace:** You can delete a Codespace after committing your changes. Inactive Codespaces are automatically deleted after 30 days, though this period can be adjusted. Using Docker containers ensures that your development environment is consistent and reproducible, making it easier to collaborate and maintain projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üü† Project

GitHub has introduced new types of projects that significantly enhance productivity and project management.
