**A Step-by-Step Guide to Using Entities, RxNorm and SNOMED CT**

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a guide on how to use Amazon Comprehend Medical for identifying medical entities and extracting information, including RxNorm codes, SNOMED CT concepts, and other attributes.
We will cover the following key topics:

-   **üè∑Ô∏è Dataset**: We will use a dataset from Kaggle related to the USMLE¬Æ Step 2 Clinical Skills examination.
-   **üè∑Ô∏è Data Extraction and Preparation:** Preparation of the dataset to extract entities.
-   **üè∑Ô∏è Real-Time Processing with AWS Comprehend Medical:** Explore how to use Amazon Comprehend Medical in real-time to analyze and extract medical information from unstructured text data.
-   **üè∑Ô∏è Batch Processing with AWS Comprehend Medical:** Discover how to set up and execute batch processing jobs with Amazon Comprehend Medical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ü©∫ Amazon Comprehend Medical

**Amazon Comprehend Medical** is a service designed to extract information from unstructured medical texts using natural language processing model (NLP) while ensuring compliance with HIPAA requirements.
This service provide the following outputs: \* **Entities**: Key medical elements identified in the text, such as medications, diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures.
\* **RxNorm Codes**: These codes are derived from a medical ontology that provides normalized names for medications and drugs, ensuring consistent identification and categorization of medication-related information.
\* **SNOMED CT**: This code set originates from a comprehensive medical ontology that represents clinical concepts such as diseases, procedures, and diagnoses, facilitating precise and interoperable health data.

> At the time of writing this article, only English texts can be processed usign this service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ°Ô∏è What is HIPAA?

The **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)** privacy rule sets national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information in the United States.

This refers to data, including demographic information, that relates to: \* The individual's past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition.
\* The provision of healthcare to the individual.
\* The past, present, or future payment for healthcare provided to the individual, and that identifies the individual or can reasonably be used to identify them, where this includes common identifiers such as name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üìö What are the vocabularies?

"Vocabularies" refer to structured sets of standardized terms and codes used to capture, classify, and analyze patient data.
These include controlled vocabularies, terminologies, hierarchies, and ontologies, and are essential for interoperability between healthcare systems, enabling data exchange and facilitating global research.
This practice dates back to the 1660s, as shown in the image below.

> "Medical vocabularies date back to the Bills of Mortality in medieval London to manage outbreaks of plague and other diseases." [The Book Of Ohdsi](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/StandardizedVocabularies.html)

![](img/vocabularies.png) Image source: [The Book Of Ohdsi](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/StandardizedVocabularies.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ü©∫ AWS Comprehend Medical: Methods for Data Extraction

After understanding the importance of medical vocabularies, we can explore how AWS Comprehend Medical leverages these vocabularies to extract and standardize medical data.

In the following sections, we will describe the specific methods used by AWS Comprehend Medical to process and analyze medical texts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ü©∫ AWS Comprehend Medical: Detect Entities

The **detect_entities_v2** method from AWS Comprehend Medical identifies and classifies various categories of medical information within a text.
Below is an image illustrating the categories detected by this method.

![](img/entity-1.png){width="768"}

For each of these classes, not only are the categories to which the entity belongs detected, but also other key values.
These values include:

-   **Type**: The specific type of entity within a category.
-   **Attribute**: Relevant information about the entity, such as the dosage of a medication.
-   **Trait**: Additional aspects that Amazon Comprehend Medical understands about an entity based on context, such as the NEGATION trait if a medication is not being administered to the patient.

Below, you can see the additional data that can be obtained for each category.

![](img/entity-2-5.png)

![](img/entity-2-6.png)

![](img/entity-2-7.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ü©∫ AWS Comprehend Medical: RxNorm

RxNorm is a standardized medical ontology that provides normalized names for clinical medications, and also It serves as a comprehensive resource for identifying and categorizing drugs and their various forms.
RxNorm links these standardized names to many other drug vocabularies, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different healthcare systems.

Below is an example with a medication and the related concepts in **RxNorm**.

![](img/rnxorm-1.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ü©∫ AWS Comprehend Medical: SNOMED CT (Clinical Terms)

**SNOMED CT** (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms) is a comprehensive multilingual health terminology system.
It provides a standardized set of codes, concepts, and synonyms to represent clinical information, including diseases, procedures, and diagnoses.

> SNOMED CT facilitates semantic interoperability by allowing mapping between different health vocabularies, such as `ICD-9` and `ICD-10`.

![](img/snomed_concepts.png)

![](img/snomed_concepts_c1.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ü©∫ Dataset

For this tutorial, we will use a dataset from **Kaggle** that is associated with the USMLE¬Æ Step 2 Clinical Skills examination, this licensing exam evaluates the examinee's ability to recognize pertinent clinical facts during interactions with standardized patients.

We will use select medical notes from this dataset to process and analyze the results obtained using the AWS Comprehend Medical service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üîß Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

-   **AWS Credentials**: You must configure the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` credentials. These are crucial for authenticating and authorizing access to AWS services.
-   **S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket to store your data. In this example, we will use a bucket named `dev-medical-notes` located in the `us-east-1` region.
-   **Permissions**: Check the IAM folder in this repository for the necessary policies and permissions to apply.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're not familiar with creating AWS credentials or setting up an S3 bucket, you can follow this guide: [Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üîê AWS Credentials**

For this tutorial, AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`) are required, these credentials are essential for authenticating and authorizing access to AWS services and they can be generated using the **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) service.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to keep your credentials secure and avoid sharing them to prevent unauthorized access to your AWS account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üîê IAM Policies and Role**

For this tutorial, you need a role and a user with specific policies applied.
In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/r0mymendez/aws-comprehend-medical/tree/main/iam), you'll find a folder containing the policies that need to be applied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üì¶ AWS Libraries**

The main libraries we will use are:

-   **boto3**: This library allows us to connect programmatically to Amazon Web Services (AWS) services.
-   **awswrangler**: This open-source Python library integrates pandas with AWS, enabling seamless data manipulation and analysis within AWS services.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üîß Configuration Setup**

To manage AWS credentials, we will use the python-dotenv library to handle environment variables.
You need to create a file named .env in the root of the project and configure your AWS credentials there.
Below, you will find the format for the file.

> File Name: `.env`

``` {.yaml}
AWS_SECRET_KEY='mySecretKey'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY='myAccessKey'
AWS_ROLE='arn:aws:iam::xxxx:role/role-name'
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations**

To simplify this tutorial and reduce the complexity of implementing a solution, two classes were created, which are as follows:

üì¶`S3bucket Class`

To simplify the explanation of this tutorial and manage the files stored in an S3 bucket, I have created a class named S3bucket.
This class will enable us to perform various common operations such as listing the files in a bucket, writing a JSON file, writing a Parquet file, and reading a JSON file.

üì¶`ComprehendMedical Class`

To make it easier to use AWS Comprehend Medical and create DataFrames from the processed data, I have developed a class named ComprehendMedical.
This class is designed to streamline interactions with the service's methods, including detect_entities_v2, infer_rx_norm, and infer_snomed_ct.
Below are the primary methods of this class and their functionalities:

-   **get_entities**: This method uses the detect_entities_v2 function from AWS Comprehend Medical to identify medical entities in a given text.
-   **get_rxnorm**: This method employs the infer_rx_norm function to extract medication-related information from the text.
-   **get_snomed**: This method uses the infer_snomedct function to identify and obtain information related to standardized medical terms in the SNOMED CT system.

> **‚öíÔ∏è Methods to Generate DataFrames** Each of the above methods also has a version that returns the results in DataFrame format using pandas.
> These DataFrames are then saved in Parquet format, which is efficient for storage and querying, and facilitates integration with other data processing tools.
> The Parquet files are stored in a new üìÅ folder named "stage" within the same Amazon S3 bucket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` {.python}
# libraries for data processing
import json, os,io,re,uuid
from tqdm import tqdm
from datetime import datetime
from pprint import pprint
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np

# libraries for loading environment variables
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# aws libraries
import boto3
import awswrangler as wr

# libraries for data visualization
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl

load_dotenv()
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY")
AWS_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_KEY")
AWS_ROLE = os.getenv("AWS_ROLE")
AWS_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'
BUCKET_NAME = 'dev-medical-notes'
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Here we are creating an object from the class called S3bucket and you can see the complete code in the following [link](https://github.com/r0mymendez/aws-comprehend-medical) of this class

``` {.python}
# create an object of the class S3bucket for the bucket 'dev-medical-notes'
s3 = S3bucket(BUCKET_NAME, AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, AWS_REGION_NAME)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üü£ Data Extraction and Preparation

The first step in the process is to extract a subset of medical notes and upload them to **Amazon S3** in JSON **{}** format.
To facilitate the organization and management of these files, they will be stored in a üìÅ folder named "raw," which will be preceded by a üìÖ date prefix (dt).

The üìÅ "raw" folder will serve as the container for the original, unprocessed files, while the date prefix will help classify and manage the files based on when they were uploaded.

``` {.python}
data = pd.read_csv('data/patient_notes.csv')
data['pn_history_len']=data['pn_history'].str.len()

# Plotting the distribution of the number of characters in patient notes
mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'
plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))
sns.histplot(data['pn_history_len'], color=sns.color_palette('pastel')[4])
plt.title('Distribution number of characters in patient notes')
plt.xlabel('Number of characters')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

![](img/plot_nro_characters.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üîç Analysis of Clinical Note Lengths**<br> In summary, there is significant variability in the length of clinical notes.
However, most notes typically fall within a certain range.
Below are the key points and future considerations for this analysis:

1.  **üìä Distribution of Note Lengths**

    -   The majority of notes are between `800` and `1000` characters.
    -   Some notes are shorter, with `less than 200` characters.

2.  **üßπ Data Cleaning**

    -   It is important to ensure that the notes do not contain unnecessary characters, such as repetitions or sequences of special symbols. It is recommended to perform a preliminary cleaning of the notes to remove these characters before processing.
    -   It is recommended to perform a preliminary cleaning of the notes to `remove these characters` before processing.

3.  **üîç Future Research Questions** <br> Although some of these questions cannot be answered with our dataset, these are some questions we could consider for analyzing a similar dataset:

    -   **Type of Patients:** What `types of patients` have the shortest and longest notes?
    -   **Relation to Severity:** Is there a relationship between the length of the note and `the severity of the patient's condition`?
    -   **Temporal Evolution:** How has the average length of the notes `changed over time`?

Additionally, since AWS Comprehend Medical processes notes up to `10,000` characters, performing this analysis is ideal for optimizing the usage of this service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
