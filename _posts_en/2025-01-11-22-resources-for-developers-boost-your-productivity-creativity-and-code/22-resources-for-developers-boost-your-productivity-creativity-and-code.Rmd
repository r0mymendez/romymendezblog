In this article, I'm sharing 22 essential tools that I've incorporated into my daily routine as a developer.
These tools cover everything from organization 📅 and documentation 📄 to design 🖌️, productivity 🚀, and programming 💻.
I've organized them into 8 categories so you can easily find the ones that best suit your needs.

### [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/postgresql)

OneCompiler allows you to **test code** without the need for installation, offering an easy way to run examples.
It supports over 60 programming languages, including PostgreSQL.\
- **Why use it**: It's perfect for practicing or verifying SQL queries without having to set up a local development environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Explain Dalibo](https://explain.dalibo.com/)

Sometimes, it's unclear why certain SQL queries in **postgres** take a long time to execute or consume too many resources.
This tool helps visualize and analyze **SQL execution plans** interactively.\
- **Why use it**: It's useful for optimizing your database performance by providing insights into query execution plans.

Here's a quick example of how to use it:

1.  Suppose you have a query that's taking a long time to execute and you want to analyze it.

``` {.sql}
SELECT 
    e.name AS employee_name,
    d.name AS department_name,
    AVG(s.amount) AS avg_salary
FROM 
    employees e
JOIN  departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
JOIN  salaries s ON e.id = s.employee_id
WHERE 
    d.budget > 1000000
    AND s.amount > (s.amount * 0.10 + LAG(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY e.id ORDER BY s.date))
GROUP BY 
    e.name, d.name
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC;
```

You can add the `EXPLAIN` keyword at the beginning of your query:

``` {.sql}
EXPLAIN
   SELECT .../* Here goes the rest of your query */
;
```

This will return an execution plan like the following:

``` {.bash}
Sort  (cost=50233.24..50233.75 rows=204 width=96)
  Sort Key: (avg(s.amount)) DESC
  ->  HashAggregate  (cost=50230.40..50231.40 rows=204 width=96)
        Group Key: e.name, d.name
        ->  WindowAgg  (cost=40230.00..40230.40 rows=50000 width=64)
              ->  Hash Join  (cost=20000.00..30000.00 rows=50000 width=64)
                    Hash Cond: (s.employee_id = e.id)
                    ->  Seq Scan on salaries s  (cost=0.00..8000.00 rows=50000 width=32)
                    ->  Hash  (cost=10000.00..10000.00 rows=10000 width=64)
                          ->  Hash Join  (cost=5000.00..10000.00 rows=10000 width=64)
                                Hash Cond: (e.department_id = d.id)
                                ->  Seq Scan on employees e  (cost=0.00..4000.00 rows=10000 width=32)
                                ->  Hash  (cost=3000.00..3000.00 rows=1000 width=32)
                                      ->  Seq Scan on departments d  (cost=0.00..3000.00 rows=1000 width=32)
                                            Filter: (budget > 1000000)
```

Once you have this output, you can paste it into [Explain Dalibo](https://explain.dalibo.com/), submit it, and the tool will display the execution analysis in a graphical format, making it easier to identify performance issues.
